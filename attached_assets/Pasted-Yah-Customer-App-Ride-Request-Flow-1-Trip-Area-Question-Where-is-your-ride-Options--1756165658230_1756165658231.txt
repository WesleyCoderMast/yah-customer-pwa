4) Passengers



Question:
“How many people are riding?”



Field:
• Number of passengers (0–10+)



Special Rule:
• If the number of passengers is greater than available seats in one vehicle, the system may assign two drivers to the same customer.
• In this case, both drivers will meet the customer, and each driver will receive an additional tip of $5+ from the customer.



(If your system separates adults/children, ask for both counts. Otherwise, use one total count.)


5) Pets

Question:
“How many pets are riding?”

Field:
• Number of pets (0–5+)

(Pet fees apply automatically if more than 0.)


6) Open Door Option (Conditional)


Rule:
• If the selected ride type is “Open Door Required,” ask:
“Would you like your driver to open the door for you?” (Yes / No)



If Yes: Add note to driver: “Customer requested door assistance.”
If No: Continue with booking.
If ride type does not require Open Door: Skip this step.



7) Pickup & Drop-off



Question:
“Set your pickup and drop-off locations.”



Fields:
• Pickup: map pin + address (auto-filled from pin)
• Drop-off: map pin + address (auto-filled from pin)



(Policy: Exact pickup and drop-off required, no substitutions.)


Price Display (Automatic)



After Step 7 (and whenever inputs change), show customer:
• Total Price
• Breakdown:
• Time: X minutes
• Distance: Y miles
• Extras: passenger & pet fees


⚠️ Do not show internal per-minute or per-mile rates.



Helpful UI Text
• In-City vs Out-of-City: “Choose In-City for local rides. Choose Out-of-City / Out-of-State for longer trips.”
• Open Door Option: “Driver can step out and open the door at pickup and drop-off if you want this service.”
• Passenger & Pet Counts: “Include everyone riding, including pets, so we can prepare the right vehicle and calculate your price accurately.”
• Pricing Transparency: “Your total updates automatically based on time, distance, and any extra passenger or pet fees.”



Buttons & Flow
• Back / Next (each step)
• Change (on summary screen)
• Confirm Ride (final action after price display)

I want to explain this to you again, more clearly, so that my points are fully understood and there is no confusion.⬇️

Yah™ Multi-Vehicle Assignment & Payments — Developer Brief



1) Passenger Input
• Question to customer: “How many people are riding?”
• Field: One number only (1–10+).
👉 If there is just one passenger, enter 1. Numbers go up from there.
• Count = every person of any age. Each rider = one seat.



⸻



2) How to Decide the Number of Cars
• Compare passenger count with vehicle seat capacity.
• If everyone fits in one car → assign 1 driver.
• If not → assign multiple cars (2, 3, or more) until every passenger has a seat.
• All assigned drivers:
• Same pickup location
• Same drop-off location



⸻



3) Payments & Tips (Multi-Vehicle Case)
• Customer pays once in the Yah™ app.
• System automatically splits the money.



Each driver receives:
• Their per-mile earnings
• An extra $5+ tip each, charged to the same customer payment



CEO (Invisible):
• CEO also receives their per-minute earnings share from every driver assigned (Driver 1, Driver 2, Driver 3, etc.)
• This must always remain hidden — customers and drivers never see CEO rates or earnings.



Transparency Rules:
• Drivers see only their own mileage + tips.
• Customers see only the total price.
• ⚠️ Never expose CEO earnings in any driver or customer view.



⸻



4) Customer Payments (Allowed / Not Allowed)
• ✅ Allowed: Debit/Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
• ❌ Not allowed: Cash, Zelle, Venmo, Cash App, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or any outside method
• ❌ No personal payments, no direct tips, no private arrangements
• 🚫 Violation = permanent removal



⸻



5) Driver Payouts
• Through Wise only
• Drivers add bank account + routing number in the Yah Driver App
• Payouts go to debit cards linked to bank accounts (no credit cards)
• ❌ No Apple Pay / Google Pay for payouts
• No payout fees ever:
• Instant payout (anytime, free)
• Automatic payout (every 4 weeks, free)



⸻



6) Safety & Conduct Rules
• ❌ No physical touch between customers and drivers at any time.
• Drivers must report any attempt of physical contact through the misconduct reporting system.



⸻



7) Clarifications
• Passenger count = total riders (all ages).
• If > capacity, assign 2, 3, or more cars.
• Pets = separate count (pet fees apply), but do not change seat logic.
• All assigned drivers meet the same customer.
• CEO earnings always included invisibly in every booking.



⸻



😎 Examples
• 6 passengers, car = 4 seats → 2 cars. Each driver gets mileage + $5+ tip. CEO earns per-minute share from both drivers (invisible).
• 10 passengers, car = 4 seats → 3 cars. Each driver gets mileage + $5+ tip. CEO earns per-minute share from all 3 drivers (invisible).
• 12 passengers, van = 6 seats → 2 vans. Each driver gets mileage pay + $5+ tip. The CEO earns the per-minute share from both vans (invisible).



2 vans = 2 large SUVs in my rule, because both mean:
• Two big vehicles are assigned.
• Together they provide enough seats for all passengers.
⸻
✅ This ensures developers understand:
• Passenger assignment logic (1 → 2 → 3 cars).
• CEO invisible earnings must never be shown.
• No physical contact is ever allowed.

Thank you so much! 🙂
