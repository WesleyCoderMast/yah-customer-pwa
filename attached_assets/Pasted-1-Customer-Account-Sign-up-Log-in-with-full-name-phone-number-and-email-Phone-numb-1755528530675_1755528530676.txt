🛡️ 9️⃣ Yah App Screen Recording & Screenshot Protection

(Applies to Yah Driver App + Yah Customer App)

🚫 No Screenshots. No Screen Recording. No Exceptions.
• 📵 All screenshots and screen recordings are permanently blocked in both apps
• 🔒 This applies to every screen:
• Ride details, payments, driver info, chat, receipts, identity, maps, YahChat, and support
• 🧠 This system works exactly like Netflix, blocking any attempt to record visual content

⸻

⚙️ How It Works:
• The Yah app automatically detects:
• Screenshot button press
• iOS/Android screen recording tools
• Third-party screen capture apps
• If triggered:
• ❌ App hides all content (black screen)
• ⚠️ Instant warning message:
“Recording is disabled for security. Your session is being monitored.”

⸻

🔐 Why This Is Mandatory:
• Protects driver and customer identity
• Prevents copying Yah’s pricing, logic, and admin systems
• Blocks fraud, harassment, and abuse of private ride information

⸻

⚖️ Violation Consequences:
• Any user (driver or customer) who bypasses or tampers with screen blocking will be:
• 🚫 Banned permanently
• 💸 Receive no refund
• 🛡️ Flagged and locked by admin@yahrides.com
